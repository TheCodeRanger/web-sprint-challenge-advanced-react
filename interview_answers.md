# Interview Answers
Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?
    >>Functional components take optional inputs (props) while class components can have state.
2. When does a componentWillMount function be called? What about a componentWillUpdate?
    >>componentWillMount will be called before rendering to the user, componentWillUpdate will show the user the changes.
3. Define stateful logic.
    >>It is any code that uses state that can have it's behavior manipulated by using hooks.
4. What are the three step of creating a successful test? What is done in each phase?
    >>Typo on line 4 (step -> steps). My brain is the first testing system. In all seriousness, I'm still a bit confused by that as I learned it today. End-to-end testing will test the application from beginning to end, integration tests will test individual parts or components of an application for user validation, unit tests will test the components and units to make sure that the software is sound.
